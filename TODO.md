imglocate should be considered mostly feature complete.
There are at least some known (and probably several unknown!) bugs and
possible TODOs:


## TODO/Known bugs

 - More gracefully handle possible exceptions/errors
 - Add a `setup.py`


## Possible TODO

 - Add an `-r' option to recursively search images in directories
